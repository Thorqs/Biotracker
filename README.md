## This branch
This branch exists for the sake of android export compatibility as the current version of Godot (4.2.1) cannot export properly in our testing.
Therefore, it is using godot V3.5.3 stable LTS, which does seem to work.
This is not the main branch and may (probably will be) behind in terms of features and the like.
Function calls are not identical between versions but intended look, feel, and functionality should be.
