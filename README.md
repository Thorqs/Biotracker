# LifePulse
Application to help users keep track of their sleep, stress, eating, water, and exercise over time.
All data is stored locally onthe user's computer and no internet functionality is required.
Data is stored in CSV format for compatibility with most analysis software.

Lifepulse is written with Godot 4.1.1, which should allow for compatibility with most platforms.
Android exports do not seem to work properly in this version of godot.
Therefore, the 3.5.3 LTS branch exists for compatibility.
Because of the breaking changes between godot v3.5 and 4.1, however, that branch will likely lag this one.
